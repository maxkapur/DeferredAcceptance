# DeferredAcceptance

&hellip is a superfast Julia implementation of a few variations of the deferred acceptance algorithm, which produce stable, incentive-compatible solutions to school-choice problems.

For a discussion of the DA-MTB and DA-STB algorithms and a few experimental results which I have attempted to reproduce here, consult the following reference:

The code in this repository is much more performant than the Python code that lives [here](https://github.com/maxkapur/assignment), although the latter has more features.
