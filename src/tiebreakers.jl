Given schools' ranked preference lists, which may contain ties,

entries of `blend`. `blend` should be a row vector with one entry
on ``[0, 1]`` for each column in `arr`. 0 means that school will use STB,
1 means MTB, and a value in between yields a convex combination
of the rules, which produces interesting results but has not yet
been theoretically analyzed. If `blend` is a scalar, use the same value
at all schools. Undefined behavior for values outside
the ``[0, 1]`` interval.

Tiebreaker function for the choice-augmented deferred acceptance
mechanism described by AbdulkadiroÄŸlu et al. (2015). Primary tiebreaking
is accomplished by allowing students to signal a target school; secondary
ties are broken by independent STB lotteries in the target and other
schools (by default). Or, indicate another mechanism by configuring
`blend_target` and `blend_others`, following `?HTB`.
