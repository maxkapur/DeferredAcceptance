"""
A collection of functions for solving school-choice problems. See examples/Tutorial.jl
for usage examples.

Some of the algorithms in this module are optimized for preference lists given
in "permutation" order, and others in "rating" order. Which order is used can be confirmed
by inspecting each function call. If the input calls for students, then the function
expects "rating" order, where if column i of students is [3, 1, 2], this implies that
school 1 is i's 3rd choice, school 2 is her 1st choice, and school 3 is her 2nd choice.
If the input calls for students_inv, then the expected input is [2, 3, 1], which means
the same. These can be trivially related via Base.invperm().
