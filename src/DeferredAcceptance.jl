"""
A collection of functions for solving school-choice problems. See examples/Tutorial.jl
for usage examples.

Some of the algorithms in this module are optimized for preference lists given
in "permutation" order, and others in "rating" order. Which order is used can be confirmed
by inspecting each function call. If the input calls for students, then the function
expects "rating" order, where if column i of students is [3, 1, 2], this implies that
school 1 is i's 3rd choice, school 2 is her 1st choice, and school 3 is her 2nd choice.
If the input calls for students_inv, then the expected input is [2, 3, 1], which means
the same. These can be trivially related via Base.invperm().

"""
    DA_nonatomic(students, students_dist, schools, capacities;
                 verbose, rev, return_cutoffs, tol)

Nonatomic (continuous) analogue of `DA()`. Students are a continuum of profiles distributed
over a fixed set of student preference lists, and school capacities are fractions of the total
student population. School preferences are optional. If you pass `schools=nothing`, it assumes
that student preferability is uncorrelated with student profile, and the schools simply accept
the best students from each profile. This is the more realistic case; the algorithm is not
incentive compatible if schools can favor students based on the students' preferences.

`rev` is a placeholder and reverse mode has not yet been implemented.

Returns a tuple expressing the assignment as an array, where the `[i, j]`` entry indicates the
measure of students having preference list `j` admitted to school `i` and `i + 1` indicates nonassignment,
and a vector giving the average utility in each preference list.

Set `return_cutoffs=true` to get the score cutoffs associated with the match, after Azevedo
and Leshno (2016). These cutoffs are the state space of the algorithm and therefore more
numerically accurate than the assignment array itself. To get only the cutoffs, use
`DA_nonatomic_lite()` (which this function wraps).
