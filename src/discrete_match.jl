    DA(students, schools, capacities; verbose, rev)

Given an array of student preferences, where `students[i, j]` indicates the
rank that student `j` gave to school `i`, and an array of the transposed
shape indicating the schools' rankings over the students, uses
student-proposing DA to compute a stable assignment. Returns a vector of
schools corresponding to each student (`m + 1` indicates unassigned) and a
list of the student rankings associated with each match. Both sets of
preferences must be strict; use `STB()` or similar to preprocess
if your data does not satisfy this.

Set `rev=true` to use school-proposing DA instead.
